**Project Objective**  
Build a Python tool using the A2A protocol where two agents communicate and provide domain-specific answers. The system should have the following design:  
- **Animal Agent (Agent1):** Responsible for answering queries about animals (e.g., behavior, habitat, species information).  
- **Plant Agent (Agent2):** Responsible for answering queries about plants (e.g., growth conditions, classification, botanical info).  

When a user asks a question or requests information, the system should route the query to the appropriate agent based on keywords or other decision logic so that, for example, if the query mentions “plant” or related terms, the Plant Agent is activated.

---

**System Architecture**  

1. **Modular Agent Structure**  
   - Create a **Base Agent Class** that defines a common interface (for example, an `answer_question(query: str)` method).  
   - Extend this class into two concrete classes: one for animals and one for plants. Each of these classes should include their domain-specific data or methods for processing queries.  

2. **The A2A Protocol Implementation**  
   - The A2A protocol in this context means agents can “talk” to each other or a main controller that delegates tasks. The main controller (or router) will analyze the user’s query and determine which agent should process the question.  
   - Consider a design where the controller function checks for domain-specific keywords or analyzes the query with a simple NLP method (such as looking for keywords like “animal,” “mammal,” “species” for Agent1 and “plant,” “flower,” “tree” for Agent2).  

3. **Main Application Flow**  
   - **User Input:** The main program accepts a user query (via terminal input or an API call).  
   - **Domain Decision:** A dispatcher function examines the query. Based on matching keywords or patterns, it routes the query to the appropriate agent.  
   - **Agent Invocation:** Once the correct agent is determined, call its `answer_question(query: str)` function and obtain the response. You can optionally include fallback logic if the query does not match either domain.  

4. **Additional Considerations**  
   - **Asynchronous Communication (Optional):** If you want to simulate concurrent agent responses or an asynchronous A2A call, consider using Python’s `asyncio` to allow non-blocking operations among the agents.  
   - **Extensibility:** Design your system so that additional agents could be added in the future. For example, implement a registry where each agent registers its domain keywords and is dynamically chosen.  
   - **Error Handling:** Incorporate error checks in case the query doesn’t belong to any recognized category.

**Sample Python Code Sketch**

Below is an outline of what the generated code might look like:

```python
import re
import asyncio

# Define a base agent class with a common interface.
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, domain_keywords):
        # domain_keywords: a list of words that help decide if this agent should handle a query.
        self.domain_keywords = domain_keywords

    def matches_query(self, query: str) -> bool:
        # Use regex or simple substring search to check if the query matches agent domain.
        return any(re.search(keyword, query, re.IGNORECASE) for keyword in self.domain_keywords)

    async def answer_question(self, query: str) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method.")

# Animal agent that handles animal-related queries.
class AnimalAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(domain_keywords=['animal', 'mammal', 'reptile', 'bird', 'fish'])

    async def answer_question(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implement animal-specific logic or look up animal information.
        return f"AnimalAgent: Here is the detailed information about the animal topic you asked for."

# Plant agent that handles plant-related queries.
class PlantAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(domain_keywords=['plant', 'flower', 'tree', 'shrub', 'botany', 'herb'])

    async def answer_question(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implement plant-specific logic or look up plant information.
        return f"PlantAgent: Here is the detailed information about the plant topic you asked for."

# The controller (router) that analyzes a query and routes it to the correct agent.
class AgentRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = [AnimalAgent(), PlantAgent()]

    async def dispatch(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Check each agent to see if its domain keywords match the query.
        for agent in self.agents:
            if agent.matches_query(query):
                # Once a matching agent is found, call its answer function.
                return await agent.answer_question(query)
        # Fallback if no agent's domain matches the query.
        return "I'm sorry, I don't have information on that topic."

async def main():
    # Get query input from the user.
    query = input("Enter your query: ")

    # Instantiate the router and get an answer.
    router = AgentRouter()
    answer = await router.dispatch(query)
    print(answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the asynchronous main routine.
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Detailed Explanation for the LLM:**  

- Start by creating a **BaseAgent** class to encapsulate the shared functionality (like domain matching) across agents.  
- For **each agent**, define a constructor that initializes a list of keywords that represent their domain.  
- Each agent overrides the `answer_question` method to return a string with domain-specific details.  
- The **AgentRouter** class contains a list of agents. Its `dispatch` method iterates over each agent and checks if the user query contains any of the agent’s keywords. As soon as it finds a match, it calls the corresponding agent’s `answer_question` method.  
- The main routine (`main`) collects user input, uses the router to determine the appropriate agent, and outputs the agent’s response.  
- Suggest incorporating asynchronous code (using `asyncio`), which simulates the A2A communication protocol by letting agents operate concurrently if needed.

This detailed description should guide the LLM to produce a Python tool that uses the A2A protocol to process queries with two specialized agents.

**Further Discussion:**  

You might consider extending the protocol for more interactive agent-to-agent dialogues. For example, if one agent needs to verify or fetch supplementary data from another agent, the code can be further modularized to include inter-agent communication channels. Other improvements could include advanced NLP classification for better query routing or a web-based interface such as with Flask or FastAPI to deploy the tool.

This approach ensures that the project is both extensible and robust, capable of handling more domains in the future while maintaining clear separation of responsibilities among agents.
